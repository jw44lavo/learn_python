learn_python
============
Welcome to **learn_python** - a small repository about learning python or programming in general. This is a guide for absolute, brutal, complete beginners. So see this as an onset to finally start to learn programming.  

This is work in progress.

# Terminology
At first we need to know about some technical terms, which are used commonly when talking about programming.  

**Script**: A script is a file, which contains assignments and instructions you wrote there. It includes all of your code in a certain language and forms a kind of protocol of tasks.  

**Language**: A language is a certain type of speaking to your computer. There are hundreds of programming languages and several language types as well. Details are not important at the beginning, but you should know following: Here you can see an introduction to Python.  

**Python**: Python is the programming language presented here. It focuses on code readability, why it is often used as an entry-language.  


# General Advice
The process of learning to program comes with an advantage and disadvantage at the same time. You just need to do it. And you will fail frequently. By learning from a book solely or without making mistakes on your own, you won't proceed.  

## Practice
The best way to practice programming is by giving yourself little problems or tasks. A very fun approach is [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) - just try it out. Alternatively you can get creative and design your own challenges.

## Help
Some would say, that programming is just about searching for the right stuff at Google. If you are stuck at a problem or never programmed what you want to program, just ask your favorite search engine. Most time of programming is about looking for the right thread at [**stack overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/).  


# Getting Started
After sorting out the general stuff, we can come the programming itself. Nearly. The following instructions assume, that you are using Windows. If you are using a Linux distribution, you should be able installing necessary software by yourself.


## Windows
### Install Python



### Install VSCode
Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is just a recommendation. You can also use any other text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).  

Download the right installer according to your operating system from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download (Windows, 32- or 64-bit, User Installer). Execute the downloaded .exe file and follow the instructions.  

### Execute your first Script
Create a new directory on your Desktop named 'learning_python'. Open VSCode and create a new file in the new directory named 'hello_world.py'. Copy following code to the file and save the progress:
```python
print('Hello World!')
```

The mother of learning a new programming language is about learning how to print out "Hello World!". It's holy programmers' codex. So just do it!  


## Ubuntu
### Install Python


### Install VSCode
